<b> Digital Painting and Drawing </b> <br> <br>
        Digital Painting and Drawing is a very popular type of Digital Art. These are similar to painting and drawing traditionally except it is done using devices. By using brushes and pens in digital art programs, artists can use this to create their own art and even vector art and animations! You dont need so start with a full setup and a stylus! Artists could even use their finger to create art on a phone!

<b> 3d Modelling, Sculpture and 3d Printing </b> <br> <br>
        Similar to making sculptures traditionally, an artist who makes 3d sculptures can create 3d models in a device using art programs catering to this kind of art! An artist who does this can create animations in 3d as well! Just like how some studios use 3d art in their professional work in shows and the like! And if one has a 3d printer, of course not needed in order to start this type of art, can print their sculptures using it!

<b> Pixel Art </b> <br> <br>
        Pixel Art is similar to digital drawing but unlike digital drawing, uses pixels as its base. <br> While yes digital drawing has pixels, they are usually quite small compared <br> to the full image, unlike pixel art that can be seen as just pixels. <br> There are certain art programs that cater to pixel art! <br> And just like digital drawing, one does not need professional devices to create them!

<b> Vector Art </b> <br> <br>
        Vector Art is similar to digital drawing, except it does not lose resolution as you zoom in! <br> There is no loss of quality when making the image bigger  <br> and is very helpful when creating logos or drawings! <br> Again, similar to digital drawing, one does not need to have very expensive tools for this! <br> However, depending on the art program, one will have to <br> find one that does accomodate vector art as not all art programs do so.

<b> Animation </b> <br> <br>
        Animation is the art of creating multiple images, <br> or frames, and making them so as they play out they as if they are moving! <br> This is also done by bigger entertainment companies for their movies and shows, like anime! <br> This can be done both in 3d and in 2d, but artists may need to find certain art programs that <br> allow this as not all art programs are able to do these, especially for 3d animation! <br> It can be quite complicated but again, one does not need very expensive tools for this, <br> although there might be some payment depending on the art program.

<b> Photography and Photo Manipulation </b> <br> <br>
        Photography and Photo Manipulation can be considered an art form depending on its use. <br> By taking a photo/s and creating art out of it, an example  would be taking snipets of photos <br> and using it to create a different kind of image (modern surrealism)! <br> But also editing an image to become a better version of what <br> it was captured in the camera can also be considered art! <br> However, if you are starting this, remember that you <br> dont need to start with a very big, expensive camera! <br> You can start with just your phone or look up images online that you can edit and use to create art!
